# Amazon Sales Data Analysis
Project Description :

Amazon Sales Data Analysis is a data-driven project aimed at uncovering valuable insights from Amazon's sales data. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project identifies key trends, product performance metrics, and seasonal patterns in sales to help optimize business strategies for Amazon sellers. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis focuses on crucial factors like revenue growth, product popularity, and price elasticity. The insights drawn from this analysis provide actionable recommendations to enhance inventory management, pricing strategies, and overall sales performance.


# Hi, I'm  Harsh! ðŸ‘‹
In this project, we conduct an exploratory analysis on Amazon sales data to identify trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and gain insights into sales patterns. This can help Amazon and third-party sellers improve their strategies for product offerings, pricing, and inventory management.

The project follows these main steps:

### Data Cleaning: 
Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

 ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzing sales distribution across various product categories.

### Identifying top-selling products:
Trend analysis over time (monthly/quarterly/yearly sales trends).

### Sales Performance Metrics:
Calculation of KPIs such as revenue per product, sales growth rate, and average order value.

### Visualization: 
Graphical representation of key insights using matplotlib and seaborn for better understanding.
